Accurate QUESTION MARK?
Question mark to my question mark, I don't know if I should USE a question mark
And question mark to that question mark because I don't even know if I need to worry about if I should use one.

Here I am wondering if I should use a question mark or not.
Wondering in and of itself is a non-interrogative question, so you can say you don't know if you even ARE wondering. But not knowing if you're wondering is still a non-interrogative question as wondering is a question because wondering and questioning are the same thing. Questioning is the act of thinking about (including posing) a question, so wondering is a form of questioning. Uncertain is not knowing, and wondering is wanting to know more, both fall under questioning, but to wonder is to first be uncertain. So by wondering you are uncertain which means you are questioning. But now I'm writing this and wondering about the grammar and philosophy of questions, meaning I am asking a question right now. So even though I am creating these statements, they're all just non-interrogative questions because grammatically a question is any sort of questioning,  so EVERYTHING IS A QUESTION AND THEREFORE NOTHING IS, QUESTIONS AREN'T REAL.
The statement "I speak a little bit of Japanese." is a question because you're still uncertain on the majourity of the language; the statement "I speak Japanese" is a question because you can ask which reigonal dialect you prefer to use, or when you started learning, or an infinite number of other questions in responce, and in all of those responces you can ask questions about the questions you just answered until you're explaining physics and the way the universe works, which requires you to speak a language, which allows you to ask an infinite number of questions. Everything links back to each other in an endless loop and in reality questions aren't real.
This entire time I have been ASKING a question, "What is a question?", and to anything, literally anything at all, there's always ONE QUESTION you can pose, "why?"

By simply making any statement, by stringing together anything, or even just existing, you are also posing a question, running through all the logic I mentioned.
