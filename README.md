# very-silly-words
A collection of things I've written. Either about my life, or thinking about why things are the way they are
This is just a place where I archive a bunch of really long paragraphs that I want to make public.

Think of them as journal entries or something, except less emphasis on reflection and more emphasis on random stuff
